#Creating a Blended Environment

Blended Learning means many things to many people. For some, it means that synchronous face to face learning time is blended with asynchronous online learning time. For others, it means the blending of physical and virtual learning spaces. For others, it means the blending of computer enhanced technologies into a more traditional learning environment.

For the purpose of our work together, we are defining blended learning as the blending of teacher directed learning with student directed learning. At times, that can make use of computer enhanced technologies (laptops, tablets, etc.), but this is not always the case. We see blended learning as a way to allow each student to have an individual learning path, one that allows him or her to be as productive and to have their learning be as meaningful as possible.

The basic principle here is that once a learning path is developed, the teachers and students can utilize whichever tools are best to move the learning forward.

We have developed a process for developing a learning path.

##Developing a Learning Path
In order to design a blended learning environment, the instructional designer must do some work to develop a learning path or set of learning paths. This process involves several steps:

###1. Determine the chunk of work under consideration. This can be a unit or set of related lessons that share a common learning outcome. For example, if I were working with pre-school children, I might have a unit called "Parts of a Book." Or, if I were teaching middle school Mathematics, I might have a unit called "Expressions and Equations." Or, if I were teaching high school science, I might have a unit called "Human Body Systems."

###2. Determine the skills or competencies that comprise the successful completion of that unit. In a kindergarten mathematics unit called "Patterning," the skills could be:
-Identify patterns of two or three objects
-Copy a pattern of two or three objects
-Extend a pattern of two or three objects
-Create a pattern using two or three objects
-Find patterns in nature that involve two to three objects.

###3. Determine the benchmarks for success for each of these skills and how these benchmarks would be assessed. For the first skill in the "Patterning" unit, for example, the student would demonstrate being able to do a sequence of tasks, such as:
I can identify patterns of 2 objects.
I can identify patterns of 3 objects.
I can identify patterns of 4 objects.
I can identify patterns of more than 4 objects.
I can identify things that are not patterns.

We can envision this as a grid with the skill, and then an example. The students and/or their teacher can check off the completion of this skill as a way of assessing whether the benchmarks have been fulfilled. When all the benchmarks are met, this skill is consider complete.

###4. Determine a method to pre-assess the students on the desired skill. There are many varieties of ways to do this given the content area, set of skills, and developmental stage of the students. In the Human Body Systems Unit, for example, a pre-test could be given to assess prior knowledge of the content area.

###5. Use the pre-assessment to shape the learning paths of students at their level and ability. In the Patterning unit, students who are already able to identify patterns of 3 objects, for example, would move on to dealing with the next skill ("I can identify patterns of 4 objects.")

###6. Determine the materials that students can interact with in order to develop and demonstrate proficiency in the various skill benchmarks. For a unit on Sorting, for example, this might include: iPad app to practice sorting; a box of materials of increasing number and complexity to sort; worksheets that allow students to practice, etc.. 
    The key idea here is to develop a wide range of materials and types of materials (2D, 3D, and digital/virtual) through which students can practice and show proficiency in the required skills. 
    
###7. Determine a system for displaying student progress through the skils within the unit. This could be a simple grid with one row per skill, where the teacher and/or student checks off the completion of the skill (or marks it with a sticker). Or it could be a spreadsheet that tracks student progress. Or it could be something more sophisticated. 
    The key principle here is that the system (whether physical or digital or a hybrid) is clear and transparent to both the student and the teacher. It also much be clear what the successful completion of the skill looks like.
    
###8. Lather, rinse, repeat
It is important that this process goes through phases of reflection and tweaking. Since the primary goal is to meet the needs of a diverse set of learners, the process must be constantly re-evaluated in light of those learners.
