#Blended Learning Readings

Here is a set of research articles about Blended Learning.
I have tried to collect papers and book chapters that were the most relevant and the least tainted by hype and other agendas.

##Theory and Practice of Online Learning

This is an open book created by faculty at Athabasca University, which is a home for practice and research about online learning.
I consider this relevant because online learning is a key component of Blended Learning Environments.

##Blended Learning Systems: Definitions, Current Trends, and Future Directions
https://www.dropbox.com/s/ptjqox2xk5o293a/Graham.pdf

This paper provides a very good introduction to Blended Learning.

##The Role of Structures, Patterns, and People in Blended Learning
https://www.dropbox.com/s/09i3v9cjwcaadpq/Derntl%202005.pdf

This paper does a good job describing the kinds of environments that could best support Blended Learning.
